About this repository
The purpose of building this repository is to create backups of my codes.
At the same time I can learn how to use git.
It is diffcult for an middle aged man like me to learn Java and framework such as Spring, MyBatis, etc.
Sometimes I remembered a poem which was written by Wang Guo Zhen.
I quote "I don't know if I can succeed, but I will keep on going when I choose the destination 
no matter how heavy the rain or how strong the wind is."
Maybe this will never been read by anybody.At least it is a shot memoir of mine.
No country for old man.
That's it.
