About this repository
The purpose of building this repository is to make backup my codes.
At the same time I can learn how to use "git".
It is diffcult for a middle-aged man like me to learn Java and frameworks such as Spring, MyBatis, etc on my own.
Sometimes I remember a poem written by Wang Guo Zhen.
I quote "I don't know if I can succeed, but I will keep on going when I choose the destination 
no matter how heavy the rain or how strong the wind is." 
Maybe this will never been read by anybody. At least it is a short memoir of mine.
No country for old man.
That's it.
