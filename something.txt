About this repository
The purpose of building this repository is to create backups for my codes.
Hence,I can learn how to use git.
It is diffcult for a aged man to learn Java.
Sometimes I remembered a poem which was written by Wang Guo Zhen.It said: I don't know if I can succeed,I will go when I choose the destination no matter how heavy the rain or how strong the wind is.
Maybe this will never been read by anybody.At least it is a shot memoir of mine.
That's it.
