2,The Jar tool provides a u option which you can use to update the contents of an existing JAR file by modifying its manifest or by adding files.

> jar uf project02.jar conf/log4j.xml    (add or update if exists the same file)

3, You can use the -C option to "change directories" during execution of the command. For example:

> jar -uf project02.jar -C conf application.yaml
