Hello, I'm Julie Candler with the BBC News.
A security law has come into force in Malaysia that gives the Prime Minister Najib Razak sweeping new powers.
 The Prime Minister said the legislation was necessary to combat terrorism, but others fear it will be used to silence government opponents.
 Michael Bristo reports. The law will allow Mr.Najib to declare any area in the country security zone, inside this area the police will be allowed to search people, vehicles and buildings without warrant.
 The legislation is being introduced as Mr.Najib comes doing increasing pressure, because of international fraud investigation into Malaysian government fund, 1MDB that he controls. 
 Mr.Najib denies wrongdoing but close associates have been implicated, critics in the security law is part of the prime minister's attempt to show off his power.
